# More functions, more nested loops

## Requirements
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for Holberton School. The goal was to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts I gained a deeper understanding of include:
* nested loops and how to use them
* functions and how to use functions
* difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* a prototype
* scope of variables
* gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
* header files and how to to use them with #include

## Description of what each file does:
0. a function that checks for uppercase character
